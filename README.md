# üèóÔ∏è Data manipulation and Machine Learning modeling of lime calcined clay concrete mechanical properties

The jupyter notebooks show how an augmented dataset from the data of different academic papers can be used for prediction of the LC3 mechanical properties by machine learning algorithms.

## 1. Problem Definition

It is shown that how different minor datasets can be augmented to have a greater dataset and the latter is used for further investigation. The next steps comprise data cleansing, feature reduction and modeling the LC3 mechanical properties by machine learning algorithms.

## 2. Data

The dataset is collected and re-manipulated from different data and results in the related academic papers.
The data for this study is split into three parts:

- Train.csv - is the training set.
- Valid.csv - is the validation set.
- Test.csv - is the test set, which is reserved for evaluation of the proposed models.

## 3. Evaluation

Different metrics of sklearn package of Python are used to get the accuracy and predictability of the proposed models.

**Note:** The goal for most regression and neural network models evaluation metrics is to minimize the error and enhance its ability to be predictable.
## 4. Features

The dataset may be handed over by request.
